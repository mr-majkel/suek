	abstract = {Local independence in the Rasch model can be violated in two generic ways that are generally not distinguished clearly in the literature. In this paper we distinguish between a violation of unidimensionality, which we call trait dependence, and a specific violation of statistical independence, which we call response dependence, both of which violate local independence. Distinct algebraic formulations for trait and response dependence are developed as violations of the dichotomous Rasch model, data are simulated with varying degrees of dependence according to these formulations, and then analysed according to the Rasch model assuming no violations. Relative to the case of no violation it is shown that trait and response dependence result in opposite effects on the unit of scale as manifested in the range and standard deviation of the scale and the standard deviation of person locations. In the case of trait dependence the scale is reduced; in the case of response dependence it is increased. Again, relative to the case of no violation, the two violations also have opposite effects on the person separation index (analogous to Cronbach's alpha reliability index of traditional test theory in value and construction): it decreases for data with trait dependence; it increases for data with response dependence. A standard way of accounting for dependence is to combine the dependent items into a higher-order polytomous item. This typically results in a decreased person separation index index and Cronbach's alpha, compared with analysing items as discrete, independent items. This occurs irrespective of the kind of dependence in the data, and so further contributes to the two violations not being distinguished clearly. In an attempt to begin to distinguish between them statistically this paper articulates the opposite effects of these two violations in the dichotomous Rasch model.},

	abstract = {Rasch fit analysis has focused on tests of global fit and tests of the fit of individual parameter estimates. Critics have noted that slight, but pervasive, patterns of misfit to a Rasch model within the data may escape detection using these approaches. These patterns contradict the Rasch axiom of local independence, and so degrade measurement and may bias measures. Misfit to a Rasch model is captured in the observation residuals. Traces of pervasive, but faint, secondary dimensions within the observations may be identified using factor analytic techniques. To illustrate these techniques, the ratings awarded during the Pairs Figure Skating competition at the 2002 Winter Olympic Games are examined. The intention is to detect analytically the patterns of rater bias admitted publicly after the event. It is seen that the one-parameter-at-a-time fit statistics and differential item functioning approaches fail to detect the crucial misfit patterns. Factor analytic methods do. In fact, the competition was held in two stages. Factor analytic techniques already detect the rater bias after the first stage. This suggests that remedial rater retraining or other rater-related actions could be taken before the final ratings are collected.},

	issn = {1529-7713},
	abstract = {By adding items with responses identical to a selected item, Smith (2005) investigated the effect of the response dependence on person and item parameter estimates in the dichotomous Rasch model. By varying the magnitude of response dependence among selected items, rather than their having perfect dependence, this paper provides additional insights into the effects of response dependence on the same estimates in the same model. Two sets of simulations are reported. In the first set, responses to all items except the first were dependent on either the first item or on the immediately preceding item; in the second set, subsets of items were formed first, and then within each of these subsets, responses to all items in a subset except the first were dependent on either the first item or on the immediately preceding item. The effects of dependence were noticeable in all of the statistics reported. In particular, the fit statistics and the parameter estimates showed increasing discrepancies from their theoretical values as a function of the magnitude of the dependence. In some cases, however, two related statistics gave the impression of improvement as a function of increased dependency; first the standard deviation of person estimates showed an increase, and second the index analogous to traditional reliability showed relative increase. In addition to the estimates and depending on the structure and magnitude of the dependence, the person distribution was affected systematically, ranging from becoming skewed to becoming bimodal. The effects on the distribution help explain some of the effects on the statistics reported. In the case of the second set of simulations in which the dependence is within subsets of items, it is possible to take account of the response dependence. This is done by summing the responses of the items within each subset to form a polytomous item and then analyzing the data in terms of a smaller number of polytomous items. This way of accounting for dependence, in which the maximum score for the test as a whole remains the same, gives a more accurate value of the reliability and a more realistic distribution of the person estimates than when the dependence within subsets of items is not taken into account.},

This statistic is based upon a comparison of individual's contributions to the sufficient statistics with the expectation of those contributions, for modeled parameters. In this paper, we present a more flexible approach in which linear combinations of individual's contributions to the sufficient statistics are compared to their expectations. This more flexible approach can be used to test the fit of combinations of items. This article first describes briefly the theoretical derivation of the fit statistics, and then illustrates how user-defined fit tests can be implemented for a number of simulated data sets, and for two real data sets. The results show that user-defined fit tests are much more powerful than fit tests at individual parameter level in testing hypothesized violations of the item response model, such as local dependence and multi-dimensionality.},

	title = {The Rasch model, additive conjoint measurement, and new models of probabilistic measurement theory},
	volume = {2},
	issn = {1529-7713},
	abstract = {This research describes some of the similarities and differences between additive conjoint measurement (a type of fundamental measurement) and the Rasch model. It seems that there are many similarities between the two frameworks, however, their differences are nontrivial. For instance, while conjoint measurement specifies measurement scales using a data-free, non-numerical axiomatic frame of reference, the Rasch model specifies measurement scales using a numerical frame of reference that is, by definition, data dependent. In order to circumvent difficulties that can be realistically imposed by this data dependence, this research formalizes new non-parametric item response models. These models are probabilistic measurement theory models in the sense that they explicitly integrate the axiomatic ideas of measurement theory with the statistical ideas of order-restricted inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The specifications of these models are rather flexible, as they can represent any one of several models used in psychometrics, such as Mokken's (1971) monotone homogeneity model, Scheiblechner's (1995) isotonic ordinal probabilistic model, or the Rasch (1960) model. The proposed non-parametric item response models are applied to analyze both real and simulated data sets.},

The degree to which the objectivity properties are attained, of course, depends on the degree to which the data fit the Rasch model. It is therefore important to utilize fit statistics that accurately and reliably detect the person-item response inconsistencies that threaten the measurement objectivity of persons and items. Given this argument, it is somewhat surprising that there is far more emphasis placed in the objective measurement of person and items than there is in the measurement quality of Rasch fit statistics. This paper provides a critical analysis of the residual fit statistics of the Rasch model, arguably the most often used fit statistics, in an effort to illustrate that the task of Rasch fit analysis is not as simple and straightforward as it appears to be. The faulty statistical properties of the residual fit statistics do not allow either a convenient or a straightforward approach to Rasch fit analysis. For instance, given a residual fit statistic, the use of a single minimum critical value for misfit diagnosis across different testing situations, where the situations vary in sample and test properties, leads to both the overdetection and underdetection of misfit. To improve this situation, it is argued that psychometricians need to implement residual-free Rasch fit statistics that are based on the number of Guttman response errors, or use indices that are statistically optimal in detecting measurement disturbances.},

	abstract = {Noise was traditionally regarded as a nuisance, which should be minimized if possible. However, recent research has shown that addition of an appropriate amount of noise can actually improve signal detection in a nonlinear system, an effect called stochastic resonance. While stochastic resonance has been described in a variety of physical and biological systems, its functional significance in human sensory systems remains mostly unexplored. Here we report psychophysical data showing that signal detection and discrimination can be enhanced by noise in human subjects whose hearing is evoked by either normal acoustic stimulation or electric stimulation of the auditory nerve or the brainstem. Our results suggest that noise is an integral part of the normal sensory process and should be added to auditory prostheses.},
